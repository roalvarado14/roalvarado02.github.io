    "text": "Gardening\n\n\nGardening was a passion I discovered during my time at UC Santa Barbara. It began with volunteering at the Methodist Church Garden where I learned the fundamentals of watering, weeding, mulching, and harvesting fresh vegetables. The experience was new, calming, and rewarding. This foundation prepared me for my next role with the Department of Public Worms at the ECP Student Farm. While the tasks were similar, the sense of community and shared purpose made the work even more fulfilling. Gardening has since become more than a hobby. It is a meaningful way for me to connect with the land, contribute to sustainability, and work with my community."

With LEED (Leaders in Environmental and Engineering Design), I contributed to the certification of Bren Hall, gaining firsthand experience in green building standards. I also partnered with UCSB leadership to assess the Isla Vista Theater and propose sustainable improvements for its infrastructure. Additionally, I had the meaningful opportunity to work alongside the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, surveying hillside erosion and exploring effective solutions to stabilize the region’s sandy soils. These experiences deepened my understanding of environmental stewardship and the importance of collaborative, place-based approaches to sustainability."

However, by the end of my first year, I discovered a deep interest in environmental science. We are living in a critical era—where climate change accelerates, biodiversity declines, and pollution levels rise—yet political inaction and denial persist at the highest levels. This reality motivated me to change my major. Since then, I’ve found purpose in studying renewable energy, sustainable urban planning, building certification systems, and critically evaluating the effectiveness of environmental strategies. My natural skepticism pushed me to approach research and case studies with rigor and curiosity, questioning assumptions and seeking practical solutions. I’ve grown a lot during my time at UCSB—academically and personally—and have come to truly appreciate the campus and its vibrant community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Santa Monica College\n\n\nSep 2020 – May 2022\n\n\nAssociate’s Degree\n\n\n\nCumulative GPA: 3.4\n\n\n\nI attended Santa Monica College from 2020 to 2022 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, with most of my coursework taking place online. It wasn’t until my final semester that I was able to experience the campus in person, where I finally connected with peers and built meaningful friendships. My academic focus during this time was heavily centered on STEM, particularly chemistry and mathematics. It was at SMC that I discovered my passion for general chemistry and statistics and where I began to envision a career driven by curiosity, impact, and purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n International Christian University\n\n\nMarch 2024 – June 2024\n\n\nStudy Abroad Program\n\n\nIn Spring 2024, I participated in a trimester-long study abroad program at International Christian University (ICU) in Tokyo, Japan. The program offered valuable exposure to Japanese academic and cultural environments, and provided the opportunity to engage with a diverse international student community. Immersing myself in a completely unfamiliar setting challenged me in unexpected ways—academically, socially, and personally. While the experience was often overwhelming, it ultimately strengthened my adaptability, broadened my perspective, and taught me how to navigate discomfort and uncertainty with resilience."
